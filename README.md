# Three-Level-Password-Authentication-System.   [vu21csen0101555]/rnallana@gitam.in
This project is made to implement three levels of passwords for mainly windows folders to simply secure windows folders. So that no one can read or write on that folder directly without entering the password or simply without unloacking the folder.
